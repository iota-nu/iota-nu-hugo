## About the National Fraternity

Lambda Chi Alpha was founded by Warren A. Cole, while a student at Boston
University, on November 2, 1909; with the expressed objective purpose
of bringing about the association together of college students of good
moral character in the various collegiate institutions within the United
States and Canada; to foster a high Christian standard of life and ideals,
to promote honorable friendship, to cultivate intellectual excellence,
to secure for members the greatest advantages in college life, to
establish brotherly love, mutual aid, close personal connection between
alumni, undergraduates and college, and to bind them together for mutual
pleasure and interest in college as well as after life by testing each
with courage, self-control, obedience, democracy and courtesy toward
all with whom they may come in contact.

Today, Lambda Chi Alpha International Fraternity is one of the
largest men's general fraternities in North America with more than
227,000 initiated members and has held subsidiaries (called chapters)
at more than 300 universities. It was the first fraternity to eliminate
pledging and remains a leader in the fight against hazing, alcohol abuse,
and other challenges facing today's college student. Lambda Chi Alpha
serves to complement higher education by providing opportunities for
academic achievement, leadership development, and lifelong friendships.
