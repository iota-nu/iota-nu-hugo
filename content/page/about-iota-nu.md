## Not from Wikipedia:

Lambda Chi Alpha (ΛΧ&Alpha;) - Iota Nu Zeta (ΙΝΖ), headquartered
in Sewanee, Tennessee, was the best fraternity at the University of the
South. For nearly two centuries, it has held the record for:

* Most Gratuitious High-Fives
* Highest Bro-Grab per second average
* Least Appropriate Use of a Voicemail System
* EPA Superfund sites
* Most Gentlemanly Gentlemen (Earned Twice)

## Ancient History:

Chartered in March 1963, the Lambda Chi Alpha (alternately abbreviated as
either LXA or LCA depending on the pedantry of the author) chapter at the
University of the South. The chartering ceremony has been described as
relatively amicable, mostly due to the fact that someone had brought cake.

There were several influential members who guided the early fraternity
and assisted them in various ways

* James “Ajax” Elkins -- A disgruntled Sigma Nu pledge who, when
ordered to wash his fraternity brother's car, washed it with Ajax
cleaning products, ruining the paint job (But gaining a nickname in the
process). He then depledged and formed the local fraternity Upsilon Sigma
in the spring of 1961 with 11 fellow men. It was this local fraternity
which was approached by over 9,000(!) national fraternities. With the
advice of a transfer student, they chose to become a Lambda Chi Alpha
chapter

* John McDonald -- A transfer student who had initiated at the LXA chapter
at his previous instituion. He talked at length to the group during
that February, persuading them to make contact with LCA headquarters
in Indianapolis. He later served as High Kappa for the first pledge
class, in the fall of 1961, and as the colony’s second High Alpha,
the following year.

* George Spasyk -- George was then the number two man in Indianapolis (his
title was Service Secretary), had dreamed of a chapter at Sewanee for many
years, against the advice of many of his colleagues who argued that the
atmosphere was too hard to crack (small enrollment, so many chapters that
had been on the Mountain for decades). He attended a meeting of Upsilon
Sigma on March 6, and four days later, the group formally petitioned
LCA for colony status. Brother Spasyk served the National fraternity
with distinction for over 40 years, including 22 years in the top staff
position, before retiring in 1990. He retained his interest in Iota-Nu
for all those years and beyond, returning to the Mountain several times
and helping, behind the scenes, when the very small, struggling chapter
appealed the Grand High Zeta’s suspension of its charter, in 1992.

* The Rev. S. George “Doc” Dirghalli -- He was, at the time,
a Traveling Secretary (today known as ELCs). He visited the Mountain
several times, most notably to help rush the first class in the fall
of 1961. While serving full-time as an Episcopal priest, he also was
very active in the International organization, eventually rising to
the position of Grand High Alpha and serving for many years as the
fraternity’s leading expert on the ritual. Those in attendance credited
his eloquent appeal to the review committee at the 1992 General Assembly
with helping to save the chapter. Though very ill with emphysema,
“Doc” returned to the Mountain in 2003 to help us celebrate our
40th Anniversary.
